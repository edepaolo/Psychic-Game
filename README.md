This repo is for the Javascript assignment. In this repo I have created a game where the user can guess which letter the computer has chosen. If the user cannot guess within a certain number of tries they lose. The game keeps track of wins and losses. It also announces when the user has picked an invalid key. The game resets after the user wins or loses so the at the user can keep playing and the wins and losses will keep totaling. Have fun!
